**CVE Identifier:**

CVE-2024-28252



**Vulnerability Title:**

QuizWhiz Input Validation and XSS Vulnerability

**Description:**

This vulnerability relates to improper input validation in the QuizWhiz project, where user-provided inputs such as quiz answers or form submissions are not sanitized or validated. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts can be injected into the application and executed on users' browsers.



- **How it works:** If an attacker submits a crafted input containing malicious JavaScript code, the unsanitized input is rendered in the browser, allowing the attacker's script to execute. This can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive user information. ï‚·  The vulnerability occurs because user inputs, such as those submitted in quiz forms or answer fields, are directly rendered on the client-side browser without proper sanitization or validation. If an attacker includes malicious JavaScript code in their input (e.g., <script>alert('XSS')</script>), the application will render the input as executable script code. This allows the attacker to hijack the user's browser session, steal sensitive information such as cookies, or manipulate webpage content.

XSS vulnerabilities typically affect web applications that dynamically insert user-generated content into HTML pages. In this case, the unsanitized data from the quiz form can be used to perform malicious actions, such as displaying phishing messages, stealing authentication tokens, or even installing malware on the user's machine.

- **Scope:**  The vulnerability impacts all QuizWhiz instances deployed without input validation and sanitization. It crosses the application security boundary by allowing attackers to exploit the trust users have in the website and execute malicious scripts on their browsers. Any user accessing a manipulated quiz page becomes a target.



- **Systems Affected:** Any instance of QuizWhiz that accepts user input without proper validation and sanitization.

- **QuizWhiz (current versions) **: All active and published versions of the QuizWhiz project that accept user inputs via quiz forms, input fields, or feedback areas are vulnerable if proper input validation and sanitization are not implemented.

- **Deployed Instances**: Any instances of QuizWhiz that are hosted on servers, live websites, or environments where the vulnerable code exists. This includes both development and production deployments where user-generated inputs are dynamically processed without escaping or filtering mechanisms.

- **Shared or Embedded Instances**: If the QuizWhiz project is embedded in third-party platforms, shared via iframes, or integrated into learning management systems (LMS), those instances may also be exposed to similar vulnerabilities if they use the same codebase without fixes.

**Severity Score:**

CVSS Score: 6.3 (Medium)





---



**Attack Vector:**

Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited via web forms or other input fields accessible to users.

**Attack Vector (AV) **: Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet.

**Attack Complexity (AC) **: Low (L) - Exploiting the vulnerability does not require special conditions or complex steps.

**Privileges Required (PR) **: None (N) - The attacker does not need any prior access or authentication.

**User Interaction (UI) **: Required (R) - A user must interact, such as clicking a malicious link or submitting crafted input.

**Scope (S) **: Unchanged (U) - The attack remains within the same security boundary.

---

**Impact:**

- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can steal sensitive user data like cookies, session tokens, or local storage information.

- **Integrity:** Malicious scripts can manipulate displayed content, impacting user trust.

- **Availability:** The application may redirect users or crash when malicious scripts execute.

**Mitigation/Remediation Steps:**

1. **Sanitize User Inputs:** Use libraries like **DOMPurify** in JavaScript to clean inputs.

2. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a restrictive CSP to prevent script execution from unauthorized sources.

   ```html

   <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';">

   ```

3. **Validate Inputs:** Ensure all user inputs are properly validated on both the client and server sides.

4. **Escape Outputs:** Use output encoding techniques when rendering user data to prevent injection.

5. **Update Dependencies:** Regularly update dependencies to ensure no vulnerable libraries are used.



---



**Real-World Example:**

If a user submits the following input in a quiz answer field:

```html

<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>

```

The vulnerable version of QuizWhiz would execute this script in the browser, displaying an alert and potentially performing malicious actions.

Project Security



1. **Input Validation:**

   - Ensure user inputs, like quiz answers or forms, are properly validated to avoid potential vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

   - Use libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize inputs in JavaScript.



2. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

   - Implement a Content Security Policy in HTML header to prevent unauthorized scripts.

   - Example:

     ```html

     <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';">

     ```



3. **Secure Dependencies:**

   - Regularly update third-party libraries to their latest versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.



4. **HTTPS:**

   - Serve website over HTTPS to ensure data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted.



5. **Error Handling:**

   - Avoid exposing stack traces or sensitive information in error messages to users.



6. **Session Management:**

   - If user sessions or scoring mechanisms persist across pages, ensure they are securely handled and stored.



7. **Repository Best Practices:**

   - Include a `SECURITY.md` file with security practices, report guidelines, and updates.



By implementing these best practices, one can enhance the overall security QuizWhiz project.
